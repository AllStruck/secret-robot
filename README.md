============

This is currently a hacked together Fabric project... still learning and working on bringing in RackSpace Cloud API (DNS and Servers) and might be using Cuisine later.

Before using you should copy [keys.json.example] to [keys.json] and update [keys.json] with your RackSpace Cloud account's API details.

I'm also using a [hosts-aliases.json] file for easier assignment of single hosts by nickname (see [hosts-liases.json.example]).
